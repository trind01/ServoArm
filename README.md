# ServoArm

Photon Code is missing but contained the following function names:

MoveSegment() - Move a segment a certain amount ("b 90")
Extend() - Full Extends
Rest() - Return To Rest Position
OpenClaw() - Open Claw fully
CloseClaw() - Close Claw fully
Shake() - For shaking a hand
MovetoMouth() - For moving food to mouth
PickUpBanana() - For picking up banana

Some of these can be infered based on the commands the Teensy received.
